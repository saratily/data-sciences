**Glossary of Notations - Model Evaluation, Cross-Validation and Bootstrapping**

W<sub>i</sub> = Residual belonging to the i<sup>th</sup> record

σ<sup>2</sup><sub>i</sub> = Variance of W<sub>i</sub> (the residual belonging to i<sup>th</sup> record)

X<sub>i</sub> = A vector for i<sup>th</sup> record

θ = Approximated weight vector

θ<sup>\*</sup> = Actual weight vector

≈ = Approximately equal to

X<sub>i</sub> = Sample time series

y<sub>i</sub> = The forecasted i<sup>th</sup> term

X<sub>i-1</sub> = Time series with lag equal to 1

U<sub>t</sub> = Error term in the forecasting model

X<sub>avg</sub> = A set of possible vectors in X and its linear combination

θ<sup>T</sup> = Transpose of the vector/matrix θ

ϕ(X ) = A transformed version of the feature vector X

R<sup>2</sup> = R-squared, i.e., fraction of variation in target variable that has been explained by the features

α = Regularization hyperparameter

|θ| = Absolute value of θ

E= Expected value

E<sub>i</sub> = Error for  i<sup>th</sup> fold in cross validation

P = Probability distribution

g(x) = A function of the inputs i.e. x to estimate the weights θ

X<sub>i</sub> = i<sup>th</sup> vector from the input feature vectors

$\overline{X}$<sup>m</sup><sub>i</sub>  =  i<sup>th</sup> random record of the  m<sup>th</sup> sample taken from the original data set

$\hat{Θ}$ = Actual value of the estimate Θ from the 푖 sample in the bootstrap

$\hat{Θ}$ <sub>avg</sub> = Average value of the estimate

var($\hat{Θ}$ ) = Variance of the estimate in the bootstrapping

se($\hat{Θ}$ ) = Standard error of the estimate
