** Glossary of Notations - Introduction to Supervised Learning and Regression **

<b>X<sub>i</sub></b> = Vector containing values of input features corresponding to i<sup>tℎ</sup> record, where i ranges from 1 to n

<b>Y<sub>i</sub></b> = Value of output variable corresponding to i<sup>tℎ</sup>record

<b>X<sub>i</sub></b> = i<sup>tℎ</sup> component of a vector **X**

θ = The unknown parameter vector

∈= Belongs to
⁫
R<sup>m</sup>= A set of m real numbers

p<sup>θ</sup>= The distribution of the parameter θ

$\hat{θ}$ = The estimator to estimate θ

g = The function of input features that determines the value of θ

E= Expected value or average

≠ = Not equal to

θ* = True quantity or true value of θ

g*(X) = Actual value of g(X)

E[Y|X]= Expected value of Y given X

n= Number of records

i = The iterator

Σ = The summation

$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}$ x<sub>i</sub> = Summation of  x<sub>i</sub> from i equals 1 to n

θ<sup>T</sup> = Transpose of the vector θ

m = Number of features

$\frac{\partial H}{\partial θ}$ = Partial derivative of with respect to It is also represented as ∇H(θ)

P(Y|X) = Probability of Y given X

Π = The product

$\prod_{i = 1}^{n}$ x<sub>i</sub> = Product of 푥 from i equals 1 to n

σ = Standard deviation

RSS = Residual sum of squares

TSS = Total sum of squares

R<sup>2</sup> = R-squared, i.e., the fraction of variation in target variable that has been explained by the features

$\hat{Y}$ = Predicted output label if no regression is deployed i.e. mean of all true quantities

var(x) = Variance of the quantity x

cov(a, b ) = covariance of the quantities a and b

W<sub>i</sup> = Residual term in the linear regression equation

N(θ*<sub>j</sub> , σ<sup>2</sup><sub>i</sub> ) = Normal distribution with mean θ*<sub>j</sub> and variance σ<sup>2</sup><sub>j</sub>

m ≪ n = m is very less than n

se($\hat{θ}$<sub>j</sub> ) = Standard error of $\hat{θ}$<sub>j</sub>

CI = Conﬁdence interval

≈ = Approximately equal to

P(θ*<sub>j</sub> ∈ CI) = Probability of θ*<sub>j</sub> belonging to the conﬁdence interval CI
