** 5.3 - Glossary of Notation: Time Series **

𝑋 = Random Variable

𝑋<sub>𝑡</sub> = Random Variable at time t

ℎ = Lag value

∀ = Indicates “for all”

𝐸(𝑋<sub>𝑡</sub>) = Expected value of Stochastic process 𝑋<sub>𝑡</sub>

µ = Mean of Stochastic process is constant value

𝑡<sub>1</sub>, 𝑡<sub>2</sub> = 𝑡<sub>1</sub >and 𝑡<sub>2</sub> are the two diﬀerent timestamps

Σ = Summation

𝑅𝑥(𝑡<sub>1</sub>, 𝑡<sub>2</sub>) = AutoCovariance

λ = Window size of the time series (the number of data points which we choose)

𝑁 = The total number of samples

$\hat{µ}$ = The summation of 𝑋 values ranging from λ to 𝑁 − 1 divided by the subtraction of total number of samples and λ

τ = 𝑡<sub>1</sub> − 𝑡<sub>2</sub> , i.e, diﬀerence between the past value and the present value

R<sub>X</sub>(τ) = Sample autocovariance for each λ

𝑆<sub>𝑡</sub> = Seasonal Component of the time series

𝑘 = Seasonality period

𝑌<sub>𝑡</sub> = Sequence of random variables

$\hat{𝑌}$<sub>t</sub> = Time series after applying smoothing (removing the ﬁne-grained variation between time stamps)

γ<sub>ℎ</sub> = The periodic regression coefficient of 𝑆<sub>𝑡+ℎ</sub> in order to remove seasonality from the data

𝑤<sub>𝑡</sub> = White Noise

σ<sup>2</sup> = Variance

δ<sub>𝑡1 − 𝑡2</sub> = Delta, i.e., change in time

𝑝 = The number of past orders to be included in the Auto Regressive (AR) model

𝑎<sub>𝑖</sub> = Coeﬃcients of the Auto Regressive model

𝑧 = Variable of the polynomial

𝑏<sub>𝑖</sub> = Coeﬃcients of the Moving Average model

𝑞 = The order of the Moving Average (MA) model

𝑋<sub>𝑡</sub> − 𝑋<sub>𝑡−1</sub> = First Order diﬀerencing

𝐴(𝑧)  = 𝐴(𝑧) is a matrix where each row acts as a regressor

|| || = Denotes the norm of a vector
