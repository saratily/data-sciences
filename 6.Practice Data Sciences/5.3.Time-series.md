# Time Series
```
Overview
Components of time series
    1. Trend
    2. Seasonality
    3. Cyclical Component
    4. Irregular Variation
decompose time series:
    1. Additive model
    2. Multiplicative model 
Stationary vs. Non-stationary
 Models/Methods
    White noise
    3-broad components
        |_ Autoregression (AR)
        |_ Integrated (I)
        |_ Moving Average (MA).
        Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
    Combining above models
        |_ Auto regressive moving average (ARMA)
        |_ Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
        |_  autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA)
        |_  Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous (ARIMAX)
        |_ Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX)

Practical Applications

## Time Series
    |_ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series
    |_ measuring same variable -> with same interval -> over time
    
e.g. 
1. Collect sales at the end of each quarter ?
- Time series
2. Collect data from different product at the same time
- Not a time series bcz each product will be different variable and observations are taken at a single time
3. Collect data at different times of a day ? may be not a time series if interval is not same

## Components of a time series
1. Trend
    |_ overall change to the data, from start to finish

2. Seasonality
    |_ periodic observations, captured over time
    |_ pattern repeats itself

3. Cyclical Component

4. Irregular Variation



## Decompose Time Series
    |_ to understand who has more influence, trend or seasonailty
    |_ compare multiple sectors, to avoid non-uniform data
    |_ Two type of model to decompose time series
    1. Additive model
        |_ Observations = trends + seasonality + error
    2. Multiplicative model 
        |_ Observations = trends * seasonality * error
    
## Stationary vs. Non-stationary
    |_ If data is gathered around consistent mean, variance and co-variance, then data is stationary
    |_ time series analysis can be perform on stationary data
    |_ if data is not stationary, then use any time series model to convert into stationary data

## Models
|_ 3 broad classes 
    |_ 1. AR Autoregression
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model
    |_ 2. I - Integrated
    |_ 3. MA Moving Average
|_ Combining these ideas:
    |_ ARMA
    |_ ARIMA
        |_  univariate method
    |_ ARIMAX
        |_  multiple variables to incorporate external data (e.g., environmental factors)
    |_ Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX)
