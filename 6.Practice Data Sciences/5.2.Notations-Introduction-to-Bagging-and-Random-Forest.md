# 5.2: Glossary of Notations: Introduction to Bagging and Random Forest

𝑛 = The number of data points

𝑒 = It is an exponential constant with the value 2.718

ϵi = Error rate of classifier at 𝑖𝑡ℎ term

𝑦𝑖 (bar) = Predicted value of 𝑖𝑡ℎ sample of the data

𝑦𝑓(bar) = Final prediction of the class through the aggregation of different classifier results

≡ = Identical to

𝑓𝑖 = The 𝑖𝑡ℎ classification model

𝑓𝑖(𝑥) = Classification models of each independent training set

𝑝(𝑓𝑖(𝑥)≠ 𝑦𝑖)  = The probability of the misclassification of 𝑓𝑖 model on the training set 𝑥

𝑙 = Total number of bootstrap training sets/classifiers

𝑇𝑙 = Bootstrap sample at the  𝑙𝑡ℎ classifier

ρ = Correlation between classifiers

𝑠 = Measure of the strength of the classifier (1 - error)

≠ = Not equal to
