# 5.3 - Glossary of Notation: Time Series

𝑋 = Random Variable

𝑋𝑡 = Random Variable at time t

ℎ = Lag value

∀ = Indicates “for all”

𝐸(𝑋𝑡) = Expected value of Stochastic process 𝑋𝑡

µ = Mean of Stochastic process is constant value

𝑡1, 𝑡2 = 𝑡1 and 𝑡2 are the two diﬀerent timestamps

Σ = Summation

𝑅𝑥(𝑡1, 𝑡2) = AutoCovariance

λ = Window size of the time series (the number of data points which we choose)

𝑁 = The total number of samples

µ = The summation of 푋 values ranging from λ to 푁 − 1 divided by the subtraction of

total number of samples and λ

τ = 𝑡1 − 𝑡2 , i.e, diﬀerence between the past value and the present value

<sub>RX</sub>(τ) = Sample autocovariance for each λ

𝑆𝑡 = Seasonal Component of the time series

𝑘 = Seasonality period

𝑌𝑡 = Sequence of random variables

𝑌<sub>t</sub> = Time series after applying smoothing (removing the ﬁne-grained variation between time stamps)

γℎ = The periodic regression coefficient of 𝑆𝑡+ℎ in order to remove seasonality from the data

𝑤<sub>𝑡</sub> = White Noise

σ<sup>2</sup> = Variance

δ<sub>𝑡1 − 𝑡2</sub> = Delta, i.e., change in time

𝑝 = The number of past orders to be included in the Auto Regressive (AR) model

𝑎𝑖 = Coeﬃcients of the Auto Regressive model

𝑧 = Variable of the polynomial

𝑏𝑖 = Coeﬃcients of the Moving Average model

𝑞 = The order of the Moving Average (MA) model

𝑋𝑡 − 𝑋𝑡−1 = First Order diﬀerencing

𝐴(𝑧)  = 𝐴(𝑧) is a matrix where each row acts as a regressor

|| || = Denotes the norm of a vector
